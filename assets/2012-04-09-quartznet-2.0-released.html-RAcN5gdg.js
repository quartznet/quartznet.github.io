Big thanks to Quartz.NET community that has submitted pull requests, patches, bug reports and for being so active and making the 2.0 release possible!

There&#39;s a first version of [migration guide](/documentation/quartz-2.x/migration-guide.html) but the tutorial hasn&#39;t been updated yet. You can also always check [Java Quartz&#39;s documentation](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation).
