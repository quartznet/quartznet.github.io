ValueTask loading could fail due the dependencies brought with activity source support. Now activity sources are only supported when using .NET Framework &gt;= 4.7.2 and netstandard &gt;= 2.0. This also raises requirement the same way for package Quartz.OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.</p><p>This release also improves trigger acquisition performance when using persistent job store, mostly by reducing network round-trips. The semaphore implementations were also re-written to gain more performance.</p><p>Also some bug fixes included, thanks to all contributors!</p><h2 id="github-issues" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#github-issues"><span>GitHub Issues</span></a></h2><p><strong>BREAKING CHANGES</strong></p><ul><li>Activity source listener is not longer part of <code>net461</code> build, only <code>net472</code></li><li><code>Quartz.AspNetCore</code> integration package minimum .NET Core version is now 3.1 for HealthChecks support</li></ul><p><strong>NEW FEATURES</strong></p><ul><li>Separate build configuration for .NET Framework 4.7.2</li><li>OpenTelemetry integration upgraded to target OpenTelemetry 1.0.0-rc1.1</li><li>Ported <code>JobInterruptMonitorPlugin</code> from Java version which allows automatic interrupt calls for registered jobs (#1110)</li><li>Rewrite semaphore implementations (#1115)</li><li><code>UsingJobData</code> now has <code>Guid</code> and <code>char</code> overloads (#1141)</li><li>Add a regular <code>AddJob(Type)</code> (#1090)</li></ul><p><strong>FIXES</strong></p><ul><li>Jobs not firing after upgrade to 3.2.x (from 3.0.7) on Microsoft Server 2008 R2 (#1083)</li><li>Jobs are not fired (#1072)</li><li><code>MicrosoftDependencyInjectionJobFactory</code> does not inject job properties for scoped jobs (#1106)</li><li>XSD schema no longer requires defining <code>durable</code> element if you just want to define <code>recover</code> (#1128)</li><li>Stack trace logging fixed in case of reporting invalid lock acquire (#1133)</li><li>Disposable job is disposed twice when using <code>UseMicrosoftDependencyInjectionScopedJobFactory</code> (#1120)</li><li><code>QuartzHostedService.StopAsync</code> throws <code>NullReferenceException</code> if <code>StartAsync</code> hasn&#39;t been run (#1123)</li></ul>',10);function c(d,u){const e=t("Download");return r(),i("div",null,[l,s(e)])}const g=o(a,[["render",c],["__file","2021-04-07-quartznet-3.3-released.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/2021-04-07-quartznet-3.3-released.html","title":"Quartz.NET 3.3 Released","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Quartz.NET 3.3 Released","tags":["releases"]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"GitHub Issues","slug":"github-issues","link":"#github-issues","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1735723320000,"contributors":[{"name":"JT","email":"975824+Hawxy@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"_posts/2021-04-07-quartznet-3.3-released.md"}');export{g as comp,m as data};
