The CronTrigger class is based on the scheduling capabilities of cron.</p><p>CronTrigger uses &quot;cron expressions&quot;, which are able to create firing schedules such as: &quot;At 8:00am every Monday through Friday&quot; or &quot;At 1:30am every last Friday of the month&quot;.</p><p>Cron expressions are powerful, but can be pretty confusing. This tutorial aims to take some of the mystery out of creating a cron expression, giving users a resource which they can visit before having to ask in a forum or mailing list.</p><h2 id="format" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#format"><span>Format</span></a></h2><p>A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Field Name</strong></th><th><strong>Mandatory</strong></th><th><strong>Allowed Values</strong></th><th><strong>Allowed Special Characters</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Seconds</td><td>YES</td><td>0-59</td><td>, - * /</td></tr><tr><td>Minutes</td><td>YES</td><td>0-59</td><td>, - * /</td></tr><tr><td>Hours</td><td>YES</td><td>0-23</td><td>, - * /</td></tr><tr><td>Day of month</td><td>YES</td><td>1-31</td><td>, - * ? / L W</td></tr><tr><td>Month</td><td>YES</td><td>1-12 or JAN-DEC</td><td>, - * /</td></tr><tr><td>Day of week</td><td>YES</td><td>1-7 or SUN-SAT</td><td>, - * ? / L #</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>NO</td><td>empty, 1970-2099</td><td>, - * /</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So cron expressions can be as simple as this: <code>* * * * ? *</code></p><p>or more complex, like this: <code>0/5 14,18,3-39,52 * ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010</code></p><h2 id="special-characters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#special-characters"><span>Special characters</span></a></h2><ul><li><p><code>*</code> (&quot;all values&quot;) - used to select all values within a field. For example, <code>*</code> in the minute field means &quot;every minute&quot;.</p></li><li><p><code>?</code> (&quot;no specific value&quot;) - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but don&#39;t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put <code>10</code> in the day-of-month field, and <code>?</code> in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.</p></li><li><p><code>-</code> - used to specify ranges. For example, <code>10-12</code> in the hour field means &quot;the hours 10, 11 and 12&quot;.</p></li><li><p><code>,</code> - used to specify additional values. For example, <code>MON,WED,FRI</code> in the day-of-week field means &quot;the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday&quot;.</p></li><li><p><code>/</code> - used to specify increments. For example, <code>0/15</code> in the seconds field means &quot;the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45&quot;. And <code>5/15</code> in the seconds field means &quot;the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50&quot;. You can also specify <code>/</code> after the &quot;character - in this case&quot; is equivalent to having &#39;0&#39; before the &#39;/&#39;. <code>1/3</code> in the day-of-month field means &quot;fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month&quot;.</p></li><li><p><code>L</code> (&quot;last&quot;) - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value <code>L</code> in the day-of-month field means &quot;the last day of the month&quot; - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means &quot;7&quot; or &quot;SAT&quot;. But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means &quot;the last xxx day of the month&quot; - for example <code>6L</code> means &quot;the last Friday of the month&quot;. You can also specify an offset from the last day of the month, such as <code>L-3</code> which would mean the third-to-last day of the calendar month. The <code>L</code> option can be used in a list, but there can only be one occurrence of the <code>L</code>. For example <code>1,15,L</code> would mean trigger on the 1st, 15th and Last Day of the month.</p></li><li><p><code>W</code> (&quot;weekday&quot;) - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify <code>15W</code> as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: &quot;the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month&quot;. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify <code>1W</code> as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not &#39;jump&#39; over the boundary of a month&#39;s days. The <code>W</code> character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.</p></li></ul><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>The <code>L</code> and <code>W</code> characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield <code>LW</code>, which translates to <em>&quot;last weekday of the month&quot;</em>. This field can also be used in a list, for example <code>1,15,LW</code> meaning 1st, 15th and Last Weekday of the month. <code>LW</code> supports an offset value, which will be calculated by first identifying last weekday, then subtracting the offset. for example <code>LW-2</code></p></div><ul><li><code>#</code> - used to specify &quot;the nth&quot; XXX day of the month. For example, the value of <code>6#3</code> in the day-of-week field means &quot;the third Friday of the month&quot; (day 6 = Friday and &quot;#3&quot; = the 3rd one in the month). Other examples: <code>2#1</code> = the first Monday of the month and <code>4#5</code> = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify <code>#5</code> and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month.</li></ul><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive.
