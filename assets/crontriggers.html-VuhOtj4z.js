Cron-Expressions are strings that are actually made up of seven sub-expressions, that describe individual details of the schedule. These sub-expression are separated with white-space, and represent:</p><ul><li><code>1. Seconds</code></li><li><code>2. Minutes</code></li><li><code>3. Hours</code></li><li><code>4. Day-of-Month</code></li><li><code>5. Month</code></li><li><code>6. Day-of-Week</code></li><li><code>7. Year (optional field)</code></li></ul><p>An example of a complete cron-expression is the string &quot;0 0 12 ? * WED&quot; - which means &quot;every Wednesday at 12:00 pm&quot;.</p><p>Individual sub-expressions can contain ranges and/or lists. For example, the day of week field in the previous (which reads &quot;WED&quot;) example could be replaces with &quot;MON-FRI&quot;, &quot;MON, WED, FRI&quot;, or even &quot;MON-WED,SAT&quot;.</p><p>Wild-cards (the &#39;*&#39; character) can be used to say &quot;every&quot; possible value of this field. Therefore the &#39;*&#39; character in the &quot;Month&quot; field of the previous example simply means &quot;every month&quot;. A &#39;*&#39; in the Day-Of-Week field would obviously mean &quot;every day of the week&quot;.</p><p>All of the fields have a set of valid values that can be specified. These values should be fairly obvious - such as the numbers 0 to 59 for seconds and minutes, and the values 0 to 23 for hours. Day-of-Month can be any value 1-31, but you need to be careful about how many days are in a given month! Months can be specified as values between 1 and 12, or by using the strings JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV and DEC. Days-of-Week can be specified as values between 1 and 7 (1 = Sunday) or by using the strings SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI and SAT.</p><p>The &#39;/&#39; character can be used to specify increments to values. For example, if you put &#39;0/15&#39; in the Minutes field, it means &#39;every 15 minutes, starting at minute zero&#39;. If you used &#39;3/20&#39; in the Minutes field, it would mean &#39;every 20 minutes during the hour, starting at minute three&#39; - or in other words it is the same as specifying &#39;3,23,43&#39; in the Minutes field.</p><p>The &#39;?&#39; character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. It is used to specify &quot;no specific value&quot;. This is useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields, but not the other. See the examples below (and CronTrigger API documentation) for clarification.</p><p>The &#39;L&#39; character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. This character is short-hand for &quot;last&quot;, but it has different meaning in each of the two fields. For example, the value &quot;L&quot; in the day-of-month field means &quot;the last day of the month&quot; - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means &quot;7&quot; or &quot;SAT&quot;. But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means &quot;the last xxx day of the month&quot; - for example &quot;6L&quot; or &quot;FRIL&quot; both mean &quot;the last Friday of the month&quot;. When using the &#39;L&#39; option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you&#39;ll get confusing results.</p><p>The &#39;W&#39; is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify &quot;15W&quot; as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: &quot;the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month&quot;.</p><p>The &#39;#&#39; is used to specify &quot;the nth&quot; XXX weekday of the month. For example, the value of &quot;6#3&quot; or &quot;FRI#3&quot; in the day-of-week field means &quot;the third Friday of the month&quot;.</p><h2 id="example-cron-expressions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-cron-expressions"><span>Example Cron Expressions</span></a></h2><p>Here are a few more examples of expressions and their meanings - you can find even more in the API documentation for CronTrigger</p><p><strong>CronTrigger Example 1 - an expression to create a trigger that simply fires every 5 minutes</strong></p><p><code>0 0/5 * * * ?</code></p><p><strong>CronTrigger Example 2 - an expression to create a trigger that fires every 5 minutes, at 10 seconds after the minute (i.e. 10:00:10 am, 10:05:10 am, etc.).</strong></p><p><code>10 0/5 * * * ?</code></p><p><strong>CronTrigger Example 3 - an expression to create a trigger that fires at 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, and 13:30, on every Wednesday and Friday.</strong></p><p><code>0 30 10-13 ? * WED,FRI</code></p><p><strong>CronTrigger Example 4 - an expression to create a trigger that fires every half hour between the hours of 8 am and 10 am on the 5th and 20th of every month. Note that the trigger will NOT fire at 10:00 am, just at 8:00, 8:30, 9:00 and 9:30</strong></p><p><code>0 0/30 8-9 5,20 * ?</code></p><p>Note that some scheduling requirements are too complicated to express with a single trigger - such as &quot;every 5 minutes between 9:00 am and 10:00 am, and every 20 minutes between 1:00 pm and 10:00 pm&quot;. The solution in this scenario is to simply create two triggers, and register both of them to run the same job.</p><h3 id="crontrigger-misfire-instructions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#crontrigger-misfire-instructions"><span>CronTrigger Misfire Instructions</span></a></h3><p>The following instructions can be used to inform Quartz what it should do when a misfire occurs for CronTrigger.

These instructions are defined in MisfireInstruction.CronTrigger as constants (and API documentation has description for their behavior). The instructions include:</p><ul><li>DoNothing</li><li>FireOnceNow</li></ul><p>All triggers have the MisfireInstrution.SmartPolicy instruction available for use, and this instruction is also the default for all trigger types. The &#39;smart policy&#39; instruction is interpreted by CronTrigger as MisfireInstruction.CronTrigger.FireOnceNow.
