The JobExecutionContext object that is passed to this method provides the job instance with information about its &quot;run-time&quot; environment - a handle to the Scheduler that executed it, a handle to the Trigger that triggered the execution, the job&#39;s JobDetail object, and a few other items.</p><p>The JobDetail object is created by the Quartz.NET client (your program) at the time the Job is added to the scheduler. It contains various property settings for the Job, as well as a JobDataMap, which can be used to store state information for a given instance of your job class. It is essentially the definition of the job instance, and is discussed in further detail in the next lesson.</p><p>Trigger objects are used to trigger the execution (or &#39;firing&#39;) of jobs. When you wish to schedule a job, you instantiate a trigger and &#39;tune&#39; its properties to provide the scheduling you wish to have. Triggers may also have a JobDataMap associated with them - this is useful to passing parameters to a Job that are specific to the firings of the trigger. Quartz ships with a handful of different trigger types, but the most commonly used types are SimpleTrigger (interface ISimpleTrigger) and CronTrigger (interface ICronTrigger).</p><p>SimpleTrigger is handy if you need &#39;one-shot&#39; execution (just single execution of a job at a given moment in time), or if you need to fire a job at a given time, and have it repeat N times, with a delay of T between executions. CronTrigger is useful if you wish to have triggering based on calendar-like schedules - such as &quot;every Friday, at noon&quot; or &quot;at 10:15 on the 10th day of every month.&quot;</p><p>Why Jobs AND Triggers? Many job schedulers do not have separate notions of jobs and triggers. Some define a &#39;job&#39; as simply an execution time (or schedule) along with some small job identifier. Others are much like the union of Quartz&#39;s job and trigger objects. While developing Quartz, we decided that it made sense to create a separation between the schedule and the work to be performed on that schedule. This has (in our opinion) many benefits.</p><p>For example, Jobs can be created and stored in the job scheduler independent of a trigger, and many triggers can be associated with the same job. Another benefit of this loose-coupling is the ability to configure jobs that remain in the scheduler after their associated triggers have expired, so that that it can be rescheduled later, without having to re-define it. It also allows you to modify or replace a trigger without having to re-define its associated job.</p><h2 id="identities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#identities"><span>Identities</span></a></h2><p>Jobs and Triggers are given identifying keys as they are registered with the Quartz scheduler. The keys of Jobs and Triggers (JobKey and TriggerKey) allow them to be placed into &#39;groups&#39; which can be useful for organizing your jobs and triggers into categories such as &quot;reporting jobs&quot; and &quot;maintenance jobs&quot;. The name portion of the key of a job or trigger must be unique within the group</p><ul><li>or in other words, the complete key (or identifier) of a job or trigger is the compound of the name and group.</li></ul>`,18);function b(m,f){const t=r("RouteLink");return c(),l("div",null,[p,n("p",null,[e("A "),d,e("'s life-cycle is bounded by it's creation, via a "),h,e(" and a call to its Shutdown() method. Once created the IScheduler interface can be used to add, remove, and list Jobs and Triggers, and perform other scheduling-related operations (such as pausing a trigger).
